KNOWN PROBLEMS:
   My program is built assuming that the user will send it the correct 
   parameters, and so it will crash if the command line contained an error
   when the program was called. In short, there is no error detection in that
   section.

DESIGN:
   This program is a brute-force solution to the problem.  It builds the query
   byte by byte in a straight-forward process and then parses the response in 
   a similar manner.  In order to isolate specific bits, I would find the byte 
   that the bit was contained in, bit shift to the right to right align the
   desired bit, and the use the & operation with a mask.  This works also for
   isolating more than 1 bit at a time, the mask just needs to be changed to 
   do so.  My method of building the query and parsing the response involves
   an iterator that keeps track of the byte that the program is on, and proves
   helpful in navigating the messages that contain many many bytes.
